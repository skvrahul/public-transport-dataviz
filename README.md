# Visualizing Public Transport Accessibility in Prague  
The aim was to visualize how much walking one would need to do to get to any point from the City Centre(MÅ¯stek Station was used as this point) while only using the public transport.
The code is written in the form of an iPython Notebook.

## Sources
 - Data has been fetched from the Bing Maps API's Transit Data.   
 - The Public transport data such as Bus and Tram routes were available from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1136378#.XOuc1tMzbBI)

## Tools Used
 - Matplotlib for Plotting
 - GeoPandas for decoding geographic data(PolyJSON, SHP Files, etc..)
 - Shapely to make use of Geometric primitives such as Point and Polygon
